## Components

- Main minibadge pcb
- Krampus add-on pcb
- 0.1uF Capacitor (0603)
- 22uF Capacitor (0603)
- 6- smd white LEDs (0603) - these are unmarked
- A mix of at least 10 (should have extras) red, yellow, green LEDs (0402) - these are marked with their associated color
- 3- 5.1 ohm resistors (0402) - these are marked green and you should have an extra
- 5.1k ohm resistor (0402) - marked red
- 5.1k ohm resistor (0603)
- UV LED (0805) - marked purple
- 5.1 ohm resistor (0603)
- TLC555 timer
- CD4017 decade counter
- 5- 2-pin male 2.54 headers
- 10k ohm potentiometer

## Assembly Instructions

Double check components against size, indicated color, and printed info on component (where available). I included extra of the 0402 components so don't use count to determine where they go. 

Start on back of main board:

- Solder the two ICs (TLC555 and CD4017) according to the orientation below. Note that there is a white line that marks the location of pin 1 for each of them.

- Solder the (0603) 0.1 uF capacitor to C1 (marked orange, orientation doesn't matter)
- Solder the (0603) 22 uF capacitor to C2 (marked blue, orientation doesn't matter)
- Solder the (0402) 5.1k ohm resistor to R4 (marked red)
- Solder (0402) 5.1 ohm resistors to R1, R2 and R3 (marked green)
- Solder (0402) 68 ohm resistor to R5 (marked black)
- Solder (0603) white LEDs to D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6. I recommend side mounting all of these LEDs (except D5) so the light is facing up. I recommend reverse mounting D5 so that the light is shining toward the board.
